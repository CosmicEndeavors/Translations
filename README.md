# Translations
The translations for Cosmic Endeavors.

# How to add a translation
Fork this repo and then use the template.json file in the **lang** folder. Copy that file and name it your language-country_inital.json. Then after adding the translation, copy the raw link and make a new entry in translations.json.

Make a pull request and say that you added the translations for your language and request review from me. Check back in a couple of days for any requested changes or if it was pulled.
